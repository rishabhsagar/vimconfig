1.  Install Pathogen.

```
Install to ~/.vim/autoload/pathogen.vim. Or copy and paste the following into your terminal/shell:

mkdir -p ~/.vim/autoload ~/.vim/bundle && \
curl -LSso ~/.vim/autoload/pathogen.vim https://tpo.pe/pathogen.vim

If you're using Windows, change all occurrences of ~/.vim to ~\vimfiles.

```

2. Create a vimrc file (Copy from this repo)
    > In Windows create a file in c:\User\<username>\
    > In Linux create ~/.vimrc

3.  To install any new vim plugin, clone the git repo of the plugin into the ~/.vim/bundle folder.
    > In Windows it is found in ( or need to be created in) c:/Users/<username>/vimfiles/bundle.

4.  Get the following plugins -> gruvbox, nerdtree, vim-airline, vim-sensible

5. :echo $MYVIMRC is the quickest way to find out the VIMRC file.  Also :e $MYVIMRC opens it up.
